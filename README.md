Analyze drug trial data to determine the efficacy of a new treatmenta


## Process 
- Dedoupe / Clean data by mouse ID 
- Calculate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- Generate a bar plot and pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
- Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
- Using Matplotlib, create a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
